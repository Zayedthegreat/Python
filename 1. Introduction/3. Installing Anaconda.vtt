Welcome back everyone.

00:02.020 --> 00:09.550
So I mentioned in the last lecture run a download and a contest to go to Anaconda dot org and go to

00:09.550 --> 00:10.740
download.

00:11.290 --> 00:19.180
It's going to bring up more of these windows and you can just download Anaconda download the latest

00:19.180 --> 00:19.690
version.

00:19.690 --> 00:24.540
So right now it's 3.6 and install that version into your computer.

00:24.610 --> 00:25.190
Make a note.

00:25.210 --> 00:29.440
If it's not offering you the correct time make sure you download the correct type whether you have a

00:29.440 --> 00:32.680
32 bit or 64 bit system.

00:32.710 --> 00:34.050
It's the same for Mac.

00:34.060 --> 00:37.380
Download the correct version of Anaconda.

00:37.510 --> 00:41.920
We actually don't use very much in Anaconda when we actually work on the notebooks we're just going

00:41.920 --> 00:43.930
to open in Jupiter.

00:43.940 --> 00:47.480
So this is the logo of what you're going to open.

00:47.710 --> 00:55.650
Like if I go to my Start Menu I click in there and then I have Jupiter notebook and this is what I open.

00:56.060 --> 01:03.110
And from here once this opens it pulls up a terminal like this.

01:03.110 --> 01:14.420
And the first time it it opens up it may ask you to cut this your all out and paste it in your browser.

01:14.630 --> 01:22.220
And when you do so what it does is it allows it to log in with that tokin and then initialises Jupiter

01:22.520 --> 01:31.920
because after you use this one time every time you open anaconda or rather Jupiter it's going to open

01:31.920 --> 01:33.110
in your browser.

01:33.330 --> 01:39.300
Just give it a minute it's going open on mine and then you can see all my various files and I would

01:39.300 --> 01:49.550
go to desktop and read the full stack and you see I'm going deeper and deeper into one of our courses

01:49.820 --> 01:52.430
and then deep learning.

01:52.520 --> 01:58.680
Let's just look at a little interpellation and I click on that.

01:59.120 --> 02:05.960
And this is actually how you run things in the Jupiter notebook and the way you execute as you click

02:05.960 --> 02:13.220
within the cell you hit a control and then enter and then you see this Asterix it means it's running

02:13.220 --> 02:14.540
the code right now.

02:15.020 --> 02:19.970
And when it's complete if there was an output it would have given an output.

02:19.970 --> 02:26.960
This is just importing stuff importing side pie pie and all these things.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.150
So at this point it's not actually doing anything but that's how Jupiter is run.

02:31.220 --> 02:36.470
So all you have to do is install Jupiter and I would ask for you to cut and paste that tokin go ahead

02:36.740 --> 02:38.450
and cut and paste that token.

02:38.830 --> 02:39.390
OK.

02:40.580 --> 02:41.870
I'll see you guys next lecture.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.290
Thanks.
