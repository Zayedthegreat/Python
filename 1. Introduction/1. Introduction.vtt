Hello everyone and welcome to the Python full stack of course with a I every section in this core series

00:10.260 --> 00:12.280
is going to begin with a slideshow.

00:12.570 --> 00:19.800
In that slide show we're going to go over a brief overview of what's going to be contained in that section

00:20.550 --> 00:25.110
before we started the course let's do the same for the entire course.

00:25.140 --> 00:28.640
So in our course we're going to have three components to it.

00:28.680 --> 00:40.210
Primarily Front-End Python and data science in front and we're going to cover HVM owl then CSSA then

00:40.210 --> 00:48.160
bootstrap java script and the document object module which is the DOM in there we're also going to be

00:48.160 --> 00:52.740
covering J queery after we take care of the front end.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.650
We're going to start working on Python.

00:54.690 --> 00:59.820
In Python we're going to learn about methods and functions all the typical programming stuff that you've

00:59.820 --> 01:04.920
heard about object oriented programming and decorators.

01:05.070 --> 01:13.320
And finally we're going to approach the data science section one of our bigger projects of the front

01:13.320 --> 01:17.490
end section is the creation of a Web site that's responsive.

01:17.490 --> 01:20.010
So that'll be our front end project.

01:20.010 --> 01:26.520
We're also going to make a game in Python we're going to be doing lots of exercises some advanced some

01:26.520 --> 01:32.940
simple in data science we're actually going to go through a great deal of data science starting from

01:32.940 --> 01:41.400
statistics all the way through deep learning in AI.

01:41.770 --> 01:49.590
There's no real point to going over every lecture right now because there's so many lectures to go through

01:50.040 --> 01:53.390
but we will approach each of these by section.

01:53.490 --> 01:58.800
So every section we're going proceeded with the slide show will give an overview of exactly what's going

01:58.800 --> 02:01.580
to be contained in that section.

02:01.590 --> 02:06.950
This is just giving you an overview of what's contained in the entire course.

02:06.960 --> 02:16.630
Our first sections after this are going to pertain to the installation of software in order to do programming.

02:16.650 --> 02:21.850
So we're going to start with installing Python then Anaconda.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.810
And after that we're going to work on installing all our code editors.

02:26.010 --> 02:28.590
So I will see you in the next lectures.

02:28.590 --> 02:29.520
Thanks everyone.
